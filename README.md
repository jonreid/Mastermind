# Mastermind (exploring TDD with SwiftUI)

I'm writing a Mastermind game to explore [TDD with SwiftUI](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-swiftui-series/). Read [the first article](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-for-swiftui-lets-begin) to learn about my goals.

There will be Xcode project configuration. There will be architecture, design, and refactoring. There will be test-driven development (TDD). And how will I approach SwiftUI?

Stick around to find out.

My plan is to live-code this project on Twitch, post the recordings on YouTube, and then turn what we discover into articles.

You can see [the Discovery Tree I'm using on Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNNVlS6k=/?share_link_id=500104344113).

**Running Tests:** The project now includes a few snapshot tests. For these tests to pass, you must use:

- Simulator: iPhone 16 

The snapshots use slightly-less-than exact precision, so that may be enough. If they fail for you, let me know.

## Live-Coding on Twitch

I’ll be streaming Sundays at 9:00 am Pacific (17:00 UTC) for roughly 60 minutes. Join so you can **chat with me live.** Chances are, you know more about SwiftUI than I do, and I’ll need your help. But I’ll be trying to apply the interesting practices listed in the [introductory article](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-for-swiftui-lets-begin). This will be real, warts and all!

## Recorded Sessions on YouTube

The following day, I’ll put the recording onto my YouTube channel. Your comments there will also be helpful.

## Articles on QualityCoding.org

Then I’ll refine what we discover into articles which I’ll post on my blog.

These articles will span a variety of topics. I expect they will cover the main categories of my blog: unit testing, TDD, refactoring, and tools. To make things easier to find, I’ve made a dedicated [TDD in a SwiftUI World](https://qualitycoding.org/tdd-swiftui-series/) page to collect the articles that come from this project, as I start from an empty GitHub repo.

Make sure you don’t miss a single post in this series. **Subscribe to my newsletter,** and I’ll notify you about new posts by email.
